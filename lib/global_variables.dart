              'Ukrainian tennis player refuses to shake Russian opponent’s hand after semifinal victory',
          text:
              'Ukrainian tennis player Anhelina Kalinina refused to shake hands with Veronika Kudermetova, her Russian opponent, following the former’s victory in the semifinals of the Rome Masters in Italy on Friday. Speaking to reporters after the match at Foro Italico, Rome, Kalinina said, “We didn’t shake hands because the girl is from Russia basically. It’s no secret why I didn’t shake, because this country actually attacks Ukraine. “So yeah, this is sport, I understand, but it’s also kind of political thing. So, yeah, it has nothing personal. But in general, yes, it’s not acceptable.” Kudermetova was asked about her relationship with Kalinina and the influence of “political overtones”, and responded, “I mean, here we’re athletes. We’re here, and we love what we do here. Doesn’t matter from which country you are. We’re athletes and that’s it. We are here to play tennis.”',

              'It had all been going so smoothly for Corey Conners. Bogey-free with only three holes to play of a soggy PGA Championship third round on Saturday, the Canadian had looked poised to take a solo lead into the final day before disaster struck. A bizarre double bogey at the 16th hole saw the world No. 29 – seeking to become just the second Canadian to lift a men’s golf major trophy – leapfrogged by four-time major champion Brooks Koepka. The American continued his charge towards a third PGA Championship with his second successive, round-best, four-under 66 to jump to six-under overall and take a one stroke lead into Sunday’s closing round ahead of Conners and Norway’s Viktor Hovland.',

          text:
              'Juan Roma won the third stage of the Dakar Rally in Argentina Tuesday as Mini teammate Krzysztof Holowczyc of Poland took the lead in the overall standings. It was the second stage win on the endurance rally for the team, with Roma coming home one minute and nine seconds ahead of the race leader at the end of the 208km leg from San Rafael to San Juan. In the motorcycle section France’s three-time champion Cyril Despres took command on their longer 270km special to claim a decisive victory and take the overall lead. Despres, who made a poor start to the 14-day race, took more than 13 minutes off KTM teammate and defending champion Marc Coma of Spain, who trailed home seventh. Dutch rider Frans Verhoeven took second with Portugal’s Paulo Goncalves in third. But another French rider, Sebastien Coue, was admitted to hospital in San Rafael after he suffered a broken shoulder and heat stroke. Argentinian rider Jorge Martinez Boero died of heart failure after a crash Sunday. Stephane Peterhansel of France led the cars at the 41 km and 163 km checkpoints, but suffered two punctures in the last 50 kilometers. He lost more than six minutes to Roma, who followed up on the stage one win over his teammate Leonid Novitskiy. But NASCAR star Robby Gordon is still in contention after taking fifth on the leg in his Hummer to move up to second overall, just 54 seconds behind Holowczyc. 2009 winner Giniel De Villiers is in third, one minute 40 seconds down in a close race between the main contenders.',

It is the fastest car I have seen, especially compared to the rest. “I don’t know how, but he [Verstappen] came past me with some serious speed and I didn’t even bother to block him because there was a massive speed difference. “Everyone wants to see a close battle, but it is the way it is. It is not my problem, it is not my fault.”',

Its bosses at the Indian board still haven’t worked out how to give it meaning. It works for the players and coaches, who get massive fees and two months of further education. To most cricket lovers, though, the teams still feel like mere franchises and the story of each game is written in invisible ink',

              'Ireland’s most beloved sporting personality faces a compelling challenge in her Dublin homecoming on Saturday night Katie Taylor is a shy and intensely private woman, despite her great fame and devoted following in Ireland, and she dislikes being the centre of attention. She is also polite, amiable and a committed Christian who has made a new home for herself in the small and quiet town of Vernon, Connecticut, where she trains for her fights. Ten days ago, just before she flew home to Dublin to prepare herself for the seething atmosphere she will generate on Saturday night at the 3Arena when she steps into the ring to face Chantelle Cameron in a difficult battle for the undisputed world super-lightweight title, Taylor explained why she loved Vernon. “The peace and quiet out here is amazing. There is nothing to do other than train as it’s in the middle of nowhere. I think it’s the perfect spot for me. The tranquillity suits my personality. You very rarely see even a car driving by, that’s how quiet it is. Nowadays this place feels like my home away from home.”',

There is a small matter of a minor groin strain to overcome first, Anderson requesting an extra match with Lancashire last week to get up to speed only to feel a twinge in the area. “Not a good twinge,” he says, meaning that while he could be ready for the Lord’s Test against Ireland that starts on 1 June, he may not be risked.',
